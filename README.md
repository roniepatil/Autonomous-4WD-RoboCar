# Autonomous 4WD RoboCar -  Python, linux, Raspberry Pi, Arduino nano, Camera, Ultrasonic & IMU sensor 
Built a self-driving robot car that can autonomously grip and transport objects in a warehouse using the implementation of sensor fusion, target detection, obstacle avoidance, localization, path planning and power management algorithms.

The robot is programmed with (at best) a crude map of the local terrain.Construction materials, here in the form of uniquely colored blocks, have been similarly delivered and are scattered about the landscape. Some have ended up where intended (i.e., in known locations), whereas others have ended up in unknown locations. Goal is to design and implement a ground robot that traverses this new, simulated domain. The robot must collect these blocks and transport them to a predetermined construction zone.
